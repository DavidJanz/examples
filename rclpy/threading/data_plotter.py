This script starts a node with a subscription to a relatively high-frequency topic.
The data received from the subscription callback calls is plotted in the main thread,

Plot updates are scheduled at a regular interval independent of the rate at which data is received.
Slow plotting calls will not block the reception of frequent data messages.
